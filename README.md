# DevCloud Tutorial 1 - Large datasets and batches
A tutorial notebook for DevCloud, documenting the flow of using a large dataset and batches.

See "MNIST_tutorial.ipynb" for the sample notebook.

Using large datasets is commonly required while working with AI/ML. While Devcloud For the Edge has great documentation on many flows, there isn't a tutorial for how to
use large datasets, or run multiple batches. This notebook will walk through how to incorporate these concepts into a base example with the MNIST dataset.
